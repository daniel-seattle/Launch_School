=begin m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))
m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))
m = monthly payment
p = loan amount
j = monthly interest rate
n = loan duration in months

When you write your program, don't use the single-letter variables m, p, j, and n; use explicit names. 
For instance, you may want to use loan_amount instead of p.

Finally, don't forget to run your code through Rubocop.
