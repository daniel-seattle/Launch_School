  Write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

  - a method that returns the sum of two integers
      Begin program
      Ask for integer 1
      assign a varable the value of integer 1
      Ask for integer 2
      assign another variable the value of integer 2
      sum the integers
      return the sum value
      End program

  - a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
      Begin program
      Accept array of strings
      create an empty string variable
      iterate over each member of the array and concatenate each value of the array to the variable
      return the variable
      End program

  - a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:

      everyOther([1,4,7,2,5]) # => [1,7,5]

      Begin program
      ask the user to input the array
      assign the input to a variable
      ask the user "even or odd?"
      if user input "odd"
        create an empty array
        iterate over the array, checking whether the index+1 of each value is inside a ruby even integer class (no clue if that odd exists)
        if the index+1 of that value is in the odd class, add it to the array created on line 30. #note we use index+1 because array indeces start at 0
      return the array containing the values with odd index values.

  - a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.

    Begin program
    ask for the string to iterate over
    assign the user-input to a string variable1
    ask for the letter to search for within the string
    assign that to a variable2
    
    create a counter variable
    create an index_tracker variable
    iterate over a string
    if letterfromuserinputstring==variable2
      counter += 1
    end
    index_tracker +=1
    if counter == 3, break the loop


  - a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:

      merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) # => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
        
        begin program
        var1 = gets.chomp.to_array
        var2 = gets.chomp.to_array
